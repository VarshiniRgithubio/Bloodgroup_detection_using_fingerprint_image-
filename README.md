# Blood Group Detection from Fingerprint

This is a **Streamlit** application for detecting blood groups from fingerprint images using a pre-trained **Keras (TensorFlow) model**.

## 📌 Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on **Windows**:
- **Python 3.10** (Ensure it's added to PATH during installation)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)
- **pip** (comes with Python)
- **Docker** (for containerization, optional)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blood_group_detection_using_fingerprint_cnn.git
cd blood_group_detection_using_fingerprint_cnn
```

### 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Without Conda)
```sh
python -m venv venv --copies
```

### 3️⃣ Activate the Virtual Environment
```sh
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4️⃣ Install Required Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5️⃣ Run the Streamlit App
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🐳 Docker Setup (Optional)
If you want to containerize the application using Docker, follow these steps:

### 1️⃣ Build the Docker Image
```sh
docker build -t blood-group-app .
```

### 2️⃣ Run the Docker Container
```sh
docker run -p 8501:8501 blood-group-app
```

### 3️⃣ Access the Application
Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8501
```

## 🛠 Troubleshooting
- If `streamlit` is not recognized, make sure the virtual environment is activated.
- If TensorFlow is missing, try running:
  ```sh
  pip install tensorflow
  ```
- If you face Python version issues, ensure you’re using **Python 3.10**.
- If you encounter issues with Docker, try rebuilding the image:
  ```sh
  docker build --no-cache -t blood-group-app .
  ```
